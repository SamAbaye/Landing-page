## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

Since this project uses the Tailwind CSS CDN and no local build tools (like Node.js or Webpack), setup is extremely simple:

### 1. Installation (No Install Required)

1.  Download or clone the files (`index.html`, `login.html`, `signup.html`).
2.  Ensure all files are in the same directory.

### 2. Running the Template

1.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2.  Navigate to `login.html` or `signup.html` via the links in the header to view the authentication pages.

## üí° Interactivity & Demo Functionality

The following elements include client-side JavaScript for a better user experience demonstration:

| Element | Interaction | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navigation Dropdowns** | Click on "Job List" to toggle the submenu. | JS toggles the visibility (`.open` class). |
| **APPLY NOW Buttons** | Click on any job card button. | Triggers a **confirmation modal** displaying the specific job title applied for. |
| **POST A JOB Button** | Click on the main header button. | This button is linked directly to the `login.html` page for an employer sign-in. |
| **Login/Sign Up Forms** | Submit the forms. | Triggers an `alert()` and redirects to a corresponding page (`index.html` after Login, `login.html` after Sign Up). |

## üìù Future Development

For transitioning this template into a live, production-ready application, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Backend Integration:** Replace JavaScript form handlers and buttons with actual API calls (e.g., using React/Vue/Angular on the front end, and a framework like Django or Express on the back end).
2.  **Local Tailwind Setup:** Move from the CDN to a local Tailwind CLI or PostCSS setup for optimized bundle sizes and custom configuration.
3.  **Full Responsiveness:** Add media queries and refine layouts for dedicated tablet and mobile screen sizes.
4.  **Accessibility:** Ensure all interactive elements meet WCAG guidelines (e.g., keyboard navigation for modals and dropdowns).
